Description: Fast subdomains enumeration tool for penetration testers
This package contains a Python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of
websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and
gather subdomains for the domain they are targeting. Sublist3r enumerates
subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, and
Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal,
ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, and ReverseDNS.
Subbrute was integrated with Sublist3r to increase the possibility of finding
more subdomains using bruteforce with an improved wordlist, thanks to TheRook,
author of subbrute.
